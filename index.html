    <p>Encanto is a colorful animated Disney movie that tells the story of the magical Madrigal family who live in a beautiful house in the mountains of Colombia. Each family member has a special magical power — like super strength, healing, or talking to animals.

But the main character, Mirabel, is the only one without a magical gift. When the magic of their house starts to fade, Mirabel steps up to find out why and discovers that she may be the key to saving her family’s magic.</p>
